"""Shared species/reaction helpers: canonical SMILES, water detection, element + charge balance.

One definition of each, used by the pipeline, the routing gates and the anchors, so that the same
molecule written differently (water as "O", "[OH2]" or "[H]O[H]") is always treated the same, and every
routing step can be checked against the one invariant a rewritten reaction must keep: element and charge
balance with the proton count carried in n_H+.

Coefficients may be fractional (ModelSEED writes e.g. 0.5 O2); nothing here truncates them to int.
