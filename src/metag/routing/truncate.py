"""Systematic reaction-level spectator truncation.

Given a reaction (reactant SMILES + product SMILES), build the SMALLEST QM model
that preserves the reactive center on both sides, replacing the conserved spectator
moiety (nucleotide tail, peptide backbone, ...) with a small methyl cap.

Why this is well-posed *at the reaction level*: we have BOTH sides in hand, so the
spectator is exactly the sub-structure that is atom-mapped and bonding-unchanged
across the reaction. Cutting it at the same point on both sides makes its energy AND
its conformer noise cancel in ΔG (validated by hand: redox 49->7 kJ noise; nucleotidyl
solved). This module automates the hand construction and adds machine guards.

Algorithm (deterministic):
  1. pair reactants<->products by maximum common substructure (greedy, MCS atom count)
  2. per pair, get the ATOM MAP from the shared MCS
  3. reaction center = {unmapped atoms} U {mapped atoms whose bonding changed}
  4. keep = reaction center grown by `radius` bonds, then RING-CLOSED (no partial rings);
     FragmentOnBonds at the boundary; cap the severed valence with methyl
Guards (all automated):
  A. balance      : truncated rxn is atom + charge + H balanced          (hard reject)
  B. consistency  : each removed fragment is identical on both sides       (else no cancel)
  C. sensitivity  : caller compares ΔG(radius) vs ΔG(radius+1) < tol       (hook: emit both)
  D. rigidity     : rotatable bonds in each reacting core                  (report, not gate)
  E. ring-closure : cuts fall ONLY on acyclic bonds (`_ring_close`)        (a priori structural)
                    -- a severed ring bond opens the ring + changes hybridization (cyclic lactone
                    -> acyclic methyl ester), a stably-wrong cut B/C cannot catch. Fixes the
                    aldose-dehydrogenase +33 kJ artifact (D-Glucose_t COC(O)C(C)O -> ring intact).

Cap-length (methyl at radius R vs the extra bond at R+1) IS the Me/Et sensitivity knob.
