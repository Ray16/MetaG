"""Thermodynamic combination of resolved aqueous species states.

Conformers share a molecular graph.  Tautomers, anomers, ring forms, and other
chemical microstates do not, and must therefore be scored as separate species
before their partition functions are combined:

    G_eff = -RT ln sum_i g_i exp[-(G_i + offset_i) / RT]

``offset_i`` is reserved for independently established state free energies
(for example, offsets derived from aqueous populations).  It must not be fit
to reaction free-energy residuals.  This module intentionally does not choose
or generate states: automatic tautomer canonicalization and a global
alpha/beta choice have both failed validation.
