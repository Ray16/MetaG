# pKa provenance and applicability audit

The runtime table in `src/metag/routing/pka_transform.py` is hard-coded. It mixes
compound constants, rounded functional-group approximations, and assumptions
about coupled protonation sites. It is not a collection of measured microscopic
constants for every metabolite. The October 6 fixes change bookkeeping and
configuration fingerprints, not the numerical pKa values.

| Runtime parameter | Evidence checked | Applicability limitation |
|---|---|---|
| `AMMONIA_PKA = 9.25` | NIST's evaluated ammonia value is 9.245 at 298.15 K and zero ionic strength [1]. | A rounded compound constant for NH4+/NH3. |
| `PRIMARY_AMINE_PKA = 10.6` | NIST gives methylamine 10.645 under the same conditions [1]. | A methylamine-like approximation. The existing classifier also uses this fallback for other amines; that extension is not independently validated. |
| `AAA_AMINE_PKA = 9.60` | The table assumes a common alpha-amino-acid value. NIST lists glycine ionization measurements near 9.78 at zero ionic strength [1]. | Neither a universal amino-acid constant nor the amine microconstant of fully neutral glycine. |
| `THIOL_PKA = 8.7` | The code cites GSH/cysteine values without primary references. NMR studies explicitly resolve interacting thiol/amine sites in glutathione [2]. | A class approximation; a single number cannot represent all thiols or all glutathione microstates. |
| `PHENOL_PKA = 10.0` | The code cites phenol/tyrosine but gives no original measurement citation. | A parent-phenol approximation. The SMARTS includes substituted phenols, whose acidity can be very different; applicability is not established for all matches. |
| `POLYACID_PKA` | Code attributes the list to Martell & Smith, via a secondary reference table. NIST independently supports the succinate pair 4.207/5.636 [1]. | Default **off**. Not every entry was independently verified. Removing tetrahedral stereochemistry conflates stereoisomers, especially tartaric acid. |
| `CARBOXYL_PAIR_LADDER` | Uses parent-acid constants; the succinate example is supported by NIST [1]. | Default **off**. Transferring a parent constant to substituted analogues requires separate validation. |
| `CARBOXYL_PKA_ALPHA["amine_neutralized"] = 4.4` | Code derives it from an assumed glycine tautomer equilibrium. A published microscopic model distinguishes neutral-glycine acid/base constants and their coupling [3]. | The independent-site product is an approximation. A macroscopic amino-acid pKa cannot simply be substituted as a microscopic constant. |
| `CARBOXYL_PKA_ALPHA["oxo"] = 1.8` | Code cites Lopalco et al., whose NMR study distinguishes oxo/hydrated states at 25 °C, I = 0.15 M [4]. | Transferring to other alpha-keto acids and adjusting to I = 0 are additional model assumptions. |
| Historical `P_N_LADDER = [2.70, 4.58]` | Chen (2017), Table 2, assigns approximately 2.7 to phosphocreatine carboxyl, with the first phosphate dissociation below 1.70 [5]. These are not reference-state microconstants. | **Automatic assignment quarantined.** Retained only for archived fingerprints/diagnostics. No guessed replacement; P-N transformations need independent state-specific data. |

The fingerprint now includes ammonia, amino-acid amine, generic amine,
imidazole, and guanidinium constants as well as acid constants. Previously an
edit to a base constant could silently preserve the uncertainty-calibration
fingerprint. Adding a name to that fingerprint does not introduce a new pKa.

The neutral-microspecies routine now assigns its existing base term to neutral
NH3, saturated aliphatic amines, and supported neutral amidines/guanidines as well as their explicitly protonated input
drawings. This fixes representation dependence within that routine. It does
not validate the constants or remove reaction-dependent routing elsewhere.

## Reference strategy

The [IUPAC Digitized pKa Dataset](https://github.com/IUPAC/Dissociation-Constants)
is a useful primary collection for an eventual measured-data lookup. It has
aqueous measurements, structures, experimental conditions, reliability labels,
and original-reference codes, with about 10,600 distinct molecules. It is
accessible under CC BY-NC 4.0; a distributable package must retain its terms and
attribution. No copy of that dataset is bundled by this change.

A compound hit is not sufficient for automatic replacement: retain dissociation
type (pKa, pKaH, pKb), temperature, ionic strength, solvent, and the identity of
the protonation transition. In particular, a list of macroscopic pKas does not
identify all site microconstants of a polyprotic metabolite. Record an explicit
missing-data status when these cannot be established.

Marvin/ChemAxon's pKa plugin supplies predictions and microspecies distributions,
not a universal experimental table. Its [licensing documentation](https://docs.chemaxon.com/latest/calculators_licensing.html)
distinguishes interactive Marvin calculations from batch `cxcalc` use. Making
it mandatory would add an external license dependency to this standalone package.

These sources support the distinctions above; they do not validate the entire
current table or its transfer to arbitrary ModelSEED compounds.

The 13 October primary-method check of Lopalco et al. [4] additionally confirms
that the main NMR samples used 9:1 H2O:D2O, 150mM substrate and I=0.15, with no
deuterium isotope correction. Table1 distinguishes a pure-water subset for
pyruvic-acid 13C measurements. Do not silently identify every tabulated hydration
constant with pure H2O at I=0, or transfer those microscopic constants to
oxaloacetate. This clarification changes provenance, not the runtime table.

An opt-in alternative now supports explicit caller-owned sequential molecular
carboxylic-acid models. See [source-backed protonation](source-backed-protonation.md)
for its full-reference, condition, ownership and missing-state restrictions.
The source-backed citrate example is a development-stage implementation check;
it does not validate the remaining oxaloacetate pool or introduce a default lookup.

   Table 2. Measurements at 25 °C and I = 0.025 M with extrapolated thermodynamic
   constants; the approximately 2.7 value is assigned to carboxyl. Its historical
   bibliography has an apparent incorrect entry, so verify original sources before

The October 6 reference-cycle experiment gave a −87.15 kJ/mol shift when using
neutral guanidine cores while retaining the old class terms. This is evidence of
an inconsistent approximate thermodynamic cycle, not evidence that the neutral
prediction is correct or that the entire discrepancy belongs to UMA. Both
reference-state-specific protonation and solvation must be tested jointly.
