"""NTP (nucleoside-polyphosphate) core reduction — isodesmic truncation of the adenosine/nucleoside
scaffold on ATP/ADP/AMP-type species.

Same family as the cofactor ring cores (nicotinamide ring). In a phosphoryl-
transfer reaction the nucleoside-ribose (adenine+ribose) rides ALONG unchanged: ATP -> ADP keeps the
whole adenosine-5'-diphosphate identical, only the gamma-phosphate moves. That scaffold cancels
analytically in ΔG, but it is huge and floppy -> its conformer noise does NOT cancel in full-molecule
QM (the phosphagen kinases run with ATP/ADP conformer-CAPPED, sigma~0, undersampled -> +44..+77 error),
and the generic MCS truncation REFUSES these (phosphoryl -> guanidinium N is not a clean ester cut).

Fix: replace the nucleoside-ribose with a METHYL cap on the 5'-oxygen, keeping the reactive
polyphosphate intact:  (adenosine)-5'-O-P(=O)(O)O-...  ->  CH3-O-P(=O)(O)O-...  (methyl polyphosphate).
The O-methyl is a spectator that cancels between both sides; the phosphoryl-transfer chemistry
(triphosphate vs diphosphate, and the acceptor P-N/P-O bond) is preserved at small scale. Isodesmic,
experiment-free -- the nucleotide analogue of the 1-methylnicotinamide cap.

GATE (self-validating, NOT a curated list): cap every nucleoside-5'-phosphate moiety, then KEEP the
substitution only if it PRESERVES the reaction mass+charge balance (same guard coa_core/truncate use).
Fires when the nucleoside is a true spectator; NO-OPs when the nucleoside/ribose itself is transformed
(e.g. NAD biosynthesis, nucleoside kinases that phosphorylate the sugar, adenylate-forming ligases).
