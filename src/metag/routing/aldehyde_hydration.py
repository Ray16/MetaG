"""Aqueous carbonyl-hydration microspecies correction (self-gating, experiment-free).

A hydratable aldehyde exists in water as an equilibrium of the free carbonyl R-CHO and its gem-diol
R-CH(OH)2 (= carbonyl + H2O). Scoring only the free carbonyl puts the species free energy too high for a
strongly-hydrated aldehyde -> sign-consistent ΔG error. The gem-diol is just a +1-WATER microspecies, so
we fold it into ONE effective species free energy exactly as microspecies.py folds +1-PROTON microspecies:

    G_eff = -RT ln[ exp(-G_carbonyl/RT) + exp(-(G_diol - G*_liq(H2O))/RT) ]

subtracting the aqueous water free energy keeps it at unit water activity, so the hydration water is NOT
added to the reaction stoichiometry (parallel to not adding H+ for protonation). SELF-GATING: a strongly
hydrated aldehyde (glyoxylate, ΔG_hyd very negative) -> diol term dominates -> G_eff pulled down (fixed);
a weakly hydrated one (GAP, ΔG_hyd ~0) -> carbonyl dominates -> G_eff ~ unchanged (no harm).

Validated (2026-08-27, hard-swap A/B): glyoxylate rxn00276 err 23.2->1.8; MAE 28.4->21.8 over 6 rxns,
every reaction correct-signed, magnitude ~ hydration tendency. This module is the PROPER (mixture, not
swap) production form.
