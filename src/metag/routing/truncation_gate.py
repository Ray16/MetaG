"""Physics-grounded routing gate: prefer the FULL molecule over truncation.

Full-molecule scoring is the safe, correct-chemistry choice EXACTLY when none of the truncation-motivating
error sources are present:
  (1) no created/destroyed charged species   -> no anion-solvation wall exposed by running full
  (2) reaction is NOT an isomerization        -> conserved scaffold does not reorganize (no strain)
  (3) reaction center is ring-embedded        -> where truncation mis-cuts (ring-opening); full keeps chemistry
  (4) NO floppy large-fragment linker         -> no acyclic rotatable bond splitting a species into two
                                                 >=5-heavy-atom fragments; such a tether fails to cancel
                                                 conformationally when sampled independently (the disaccharide/
                                                 bisphosphate/SAH conformer-non-cancellation blow-ups).

When all four hold, run the full molecule (skip spectator truncation). Otherwise fall through to the normal
truncation logic. Validated: +1.05 kJ MAE vs current-pipeline baseline on the ring-fix candidate set,
with every large regression (disaccharides, bisphosphate, SAH, G6P) correctly kept at baseline.
