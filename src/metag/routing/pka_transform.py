"""Construct protonation reference species and independent-site pKa terms.

Reference changes can reduce the difficulty of charged-species calculations,
but accuracy requires pKas for the actual reference microstates. Neutralization
alone does not establish accurate UMA energies, solvation, or state populations.

No reaction Gibbs energies are fitted here. Table values are parent-compound
constants and class approximations; the optional site provider uses independent
pKa data. Sequential macroscopic ladders are not generally independent sites.
Acid and base terms use the stable partition functions in energetics.protonation.
Matched per-side terms cancel; such cancellation does not validate omitted
interactions or the transfer of a group constant to a different environment.

Unsupported phosphoryl environments and the unverified P-N ladder fail explicitly.
Other recognized groups retain the limitations recorded in docs/pka-provenance.md.
